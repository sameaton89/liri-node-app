{"Title:":"Fuck","Year:":"2005","Rated:":"NOT RATED","IMDB Rating:":"7.1","Country:":"USA","Language:":"English","Plot:":"This documentary takes a look on all sides of the infamous F-word. It's taboo,obscene and controversial, yet somehow seems to permeate every single aspect of our culture - from Hollywood, to the schoolyard to the Senate floor in Washington D.C. It's the word at the very center of the debate on Free Speech - and everyone seems to have an opinion. FUCK exams how the word is impacting our world today through interviews, film and television clips, music, and original animation by Bill Plympton. Scholars and linguists examine the long history of fuck. Comedians, actors, and writers who have charted and popularized the upward course of fuck are heard from, often while defending the Constitutional Right of Free Speech, all the way to the Supreme Court. FUCK visits with those who actually fuck for a living. We hear from advocates who oppose fuck and its infringement into our everyday lives. We watch some of the most famous and infamous film and television clips that feature fuck, we hear some of the most famous fucks ever uttered and we'll feel the impact of fuck on our everyday lives.","Actors:":"Reinhold Aman, Steven Bochco, Pat Boone, Benjamin C. Bradlee","Rotten Tomatoes Rating:":"56%"}
